# Games
Games created in Java:

I created a version of the game Space Invaders as a final project for the class
CSE_131 (Fall 2016), and created all the other games as personal projects to
further practice the learned skills

All these games consist of a simple, elegant Main method that directly depends on
the secondary methods and objects created
